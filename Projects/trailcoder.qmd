Trail Coder was created in Twine. Trail Coder is based on the video game classic The Oregon Trail, but is intended to teach players some of the basic mechanics of coding in python.

Twine is a free software that is available for download and can be used to create choose-your-own adventure-type stories, which makes it an ideal platform for developing a choice-based video game. Since The Oregon Trail works on basic mechanics of player choice, we thought Twine would be an ideal platform to develop Trail Coder.
