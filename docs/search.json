    "text": "This study examines how personalized learning attributes in informal, collaborative learning environments can impact reflections in middle and high school students. Six adolescent participants from three countries were interviewed following their participation in collaborating on STEM-related media projects. Analysis was conducted using epistemic network analysis examining interpersonal and intrapersonal codes. Statistically significant results with relatively small n indicate that the reflections of middle school students differed from those of high school students. Both middle and high school students expressed connections to Self-awareness and Cross-cultural Disposition, suggesting that personalized learning impacts students’ emotional intelligence (EI). However, middle school students expressed weaker connections in Self-awareness and Social Disposition than high school students, suggesting more exposure to personalized learning increases EI.\nDOI: 10.3102/2016743\nDownload Paper"

    "text": "Identity formation is central to positive adolescent development as young learners navigate collaborative, educational environments (McLean & Breen, 2009). A positive personal identity is associated with increased subjective well-being, positive academic self-concepts, and a stronger sense of agency (Booker et al., 2021; Ricks et al., 2021). Adolescents spend a significant portion of their development in educational spaces. As a result, it is vital to identify how adolescents develop a stronger sense of self in academic environments by presenting collaborative, learning opportunities. In this paper, we seek to evaluate various themes of identity development through the lens of self-authorship and agency by analyzing individual reflective interviews of adolescent learners.\nDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-93859-8_17\nDownload Paper"

    "text": "Abstract\nThis project aimed to develop a Shiny app that generates an interactive constellation maps, leveraging computational and visualization techniques. Utilizing the datasets are available in GeoJSON (.geojson) and GeoPackage (.gpkg) formats, we will be using three of the available data: the milkyway, the constellation lines, and the stars. The primary objective is to prioritize accessibility and personalization by allowing users to input specific geographic locations and time, resulting in contextually relevant and visually captivating constellation maps. The significance of this project is to enhance the appeal and educational value of stargazing by tailoring the experience through diverse elements such as color schemes, map locations, time zones, and latitude/longitude inputs. Furthermore, the app will be crafted with a user-friendly interface, aiming for inclusivity across diverse backgrounds and levels of astronomical expertise."
