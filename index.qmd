My teaching experience includes serving as the instructor of record for EDP/PSY/HDFS 200: Evolution & Human Development at the University of Arizona, where I led undergraduate students in exploring human development. I have worked as a teaching assistant for graduate-level statistics courses, including EDP 541 (Statistical Methods in Education), EDP 641 (Selected Applications of Statistical Methods), and EDP 646 (Multivariate Methods in Education), providing support in understanding statistical concepts and leading in-person R and SPSS workshops.

My current research focuses on digital game-based learning and academic identity development for undergraduate students, specifically exploring how to promote positive expectancy-value beliefs. I also research on informal learning environments, emotion regulation, and acculturative stress in higher education settings.
